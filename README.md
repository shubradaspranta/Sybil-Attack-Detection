# Sybil-Attack-Detection
Sybil attack is a security threat where attackers can create multiple fake identities. To prevent this attack I am introducing you a hybrid deep learning based detection model.

# Sybil Attack Detection using CNN + RNN

This project presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting Sybil attacks in blockchain or distributed network environments using a hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

## 📌 Overview

Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems by allowing malicious users to create multiple fake identities. This repository provides an implementation of a Sybil detection model leveraging the strengths of both CNN (for spatial pattern recognition) and RNN (for sequence behavior analysis).

The pipeline includes:
- Data preprocessing
- CNN+RNN hybrid model design
- Model training & evaluation
- Prediction & anomaly detection
